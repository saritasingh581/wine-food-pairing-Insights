🍷 Wine & Food Pairing Dashboard  

📊 Project Overview  

This Power BI project explores the relationship between wine types and food pairings, analyzing how well different combinations work together.  
The dashboard highlights insights like average pairing quality, top-performing cuisines, and excellence rates — helping visualize the art of wine-food pairing through data.  

🧩 Key KPIs

- Total Pairings — Total number of wine–food combinations

- Average Pairing Quality — Average quality rating across all pairings

- Excellent Pairing % — Percentage of pairings rated as “Excellent”

- High Quality Pairing % — Percentage of pairings rated as “High Quality”

⚙️ Tools Used

- Power BI – for data visualization & dashboard creation

- Excel – for cleaning and preparing datasets

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs

- Kaggle Dataset – Source of raw data
